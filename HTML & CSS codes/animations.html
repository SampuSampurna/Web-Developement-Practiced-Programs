Animations:
Animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.
Animation properties :
1.@keyframes: (from to) (0%,25%,50%,75%,100%)
2.animation-name:give the name which is specify in the @key frames 
3.animation-duration:duration os animation like 4s 5s 6s
4.animation-delay:which delay the animation time & animation time also given in        negative values ex -2 time is given then the animation start from 2 sec
5.animation-iteration-count: how many times iteration should occur and also we can give infinite for infinite times 
6.animation-direction:direction of animation
    normal:played as normal(forward) this is default
    reverse:played in reverse direction(backward)
    alternate:played in forwards first, then backwards
    alternate-reverse:played backwards first then forward
7.animation-timing-function:speed curve of the animations
    ease:slow start,then fast,then end slowly
    linear:same speed from start to end
    ease-in:slow start
    ease-end:sloe end 
    easein-ut:slow start and end
    cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
8.animation-fill-mode:
    none:default value
    forwards:last keyframe is constant
    backward:first key frame is constant
    both:The extending the animation properties in both directions
9.animation shorthand property:
     animation-name: example;
     animation-duration: 5s;
     animation-timing-function: linear;
     animation-delay: 2s;
     animation-iteration-count: infinite;
     animation-direction: alternate;
   
    animation: example 5s linear 2s infinite alternate;
